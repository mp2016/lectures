# Midterm Evaluation results and action plan

All items are noted with how many people agreed or disagreed, using the following legend:
- A = Agree
- - = Neither/nor
- D = Disagree


## Good things

- Lectures are great. Interactive teaching and sparring with students. 5A
- Interesting to learn about how Microservices are used in a wide variety of applications, etc. 3A 2-
- It's very open, what a microservice is. 5-
- I like Jolie. 4A 1-
- The lecture format is nice. 5A
- Interesting topics/technologies. 5A
- Live coding. 5A
- New paradigms, regarding microservices - from Jolie to the subjects presented. 5A
- Brush-up on presentations. 5A
- The contents of the course. 5A
- General atmosphere of the lectures. 5A
- Very relaxed environment during lectures. 5A
- Flexibility wrt focus/content of the course. 5A
- Focus on individual studies + projects. 5A

## Improvements

- A little more structure/directions/focus towards the exam project. 5A
- A clear specification on what exam projects
should be about and include. 4A 1D
  * Action: there will be a formal specification for the format of the final report.
  * Action: discuss some ideas from the teacher for possible projects and some projects from the previous years.
- Sometimes a question/topic takes the teacher 'off-course', consumes a lot of time. 5D
  * Suggestion: interrupt the teacher when you feel like a topic was not closed after we jumped to another related topic. The teacher is trying to close all sub-topics while in "sparring mode" with the students.
- Lacking a clear curriculum. 5A
  * Action: many parts are actually fixed (microservices, learning Jolie, design patterns for microservices, giving presentations). We can add a syllabus in the code repository to remember the issues and concepts addressed in the lectures.
- More tutorials, practical lab sessions to play around with Jolie. 5A
  * Action: use some lectures for giving very practical tutorials about some technologies, e.g., database management in Jolie or async computation in Java.
  * Suggestion: give feedback on the specific topics that we could dive into, e.g., how to use an HTML form in Jolie.
- Limited "fixed" content. 3A 2-
  * See comments on the curriculum.
